# Configure Conditional Access policy

## Introduction

Conditional Access policies at their simplest are if-then statements, if a user wants to access a resource, then they must complete an action. Example: A payroll manager wants to access the payroll application and is required to perform multi-factor authentication to access it.

## Use Case

Some use cases for Conditional Access are:

* Requiring multi-factor authentication for users with administrative roles
* Requiring multi-factor authentication for Azure management tasks
* Blocking sign-ins for users attempting to use legacy authentication protocols
* Requiring trusted locations for Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication registration
* Blocking or granting access from specific locations
* Blocking risky sign-in behaviors
* Requiring organization-managed devices for specific applications

## Cloud Research

During this lab I created a policy that enables Multi-Factor Authentication when accessing the Azure Admin portal. I was able to deploy the policy to only a handful of users to make sure it works as expected.
