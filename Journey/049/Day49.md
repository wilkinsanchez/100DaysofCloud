# MacOS deployment with Microsoft Intune

## Introduction

✍️ I picked a MacOS deployment and comprehensive setup of custom apps, .mobileconfig scripts, robust security configurations, account management, and more. As a Windows user, I wanted to gain more expertise in MacOS management and Intune's capabilities.

During this lab, I worked on the following:

1. Virtual environment: Configured a virtual environment with VmWare to access multiple MacOS systems at once.
2. Apple MDM Push Certificate: Successfully integrated, enabling secure management of MacOS Devices.
3. Enrolled MacOS devices to Intune: Successfully added devices to Intune using a test tenant for deployment.
4. Security Settings: Focused on robust security configurations to protect against emerging threats.
5. User Settings: Customized for an enhanced user experience, ensuring a balance between user needs and company's policies.
6. .mobileconfig files: Created .mobileconfig scripts for detailed customizations. For instance, dock settings, hiding specific system preferences, and setting up bookmarks for a streamlined user experience.
