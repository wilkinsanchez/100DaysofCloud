# Working with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Introduction

# What is Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

Defender for Cloud is a tool for security posture management and threat protection. It strengthens the security posture of your cloud resources, and with its integrated Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for Cloud protects workloads running in Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms.

Defender for Cloud provides the tools needed to harden your resources, track your security posture, protect against cyber attacks, and streamline security management. Because it's natively integrated, deployment of Defender for Cloud is easy, providing you with simple auto provisioning to secure your resources by default.

# What is Azure Arc?

Today, companies struggle to control and govern increasingly complex environments. These environments extend across data centers, multiple clouds, and edge. Each environment and cloud possesses its own set of disjointed management tools that you need to learn and operate.

In parallel, new DevOps and ITOps operational models are hard to implement, as existing tools fail to provide support for new cloud native patterns.

Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Azure Arc enables you to:

* Manage your entire environment, with a single pane of glass, by projecting your existing non-Azure, on-premises, or other-cloud resources into Azure Resource Manager.
* Manage virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases as if they are running in Azure.
* Use familiar Azure services and management capabilities, regardless of where they live.
* Continue using traditional ITOps, while introducing DevOps practices to support new cloud native patterns in your environment.
* Configure Custom Locations as an abstraction layer on top of Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, cluster connect, and cluster extensions.

## Cloud Research

During this lab, I worked on the following:

* Learned about Microsoft Defender for Cloud
* Learned about Azure Arc
* Created a Log Analytics Workspace
* Enabled Microsoft Defender for Cloud
* Installed Azure Arc on an on-prem server
* Protected the on-prem server
* Working knowledge of mitigating threats using the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal
