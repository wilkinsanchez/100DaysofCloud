# Working with Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Introduction

Defender for Cloud is a tool for security posture management and threat protection. It strengthens the security posture of your cloud resources, and with its integrated Microsoft Defender plans, Defender for Cloud protects workloads running in Azure, hybrid, and other cloud platforms.

Defender for Cloud provides the tools needed to harden your resources, track your security posture, protect against cyber attacks, and streamline security management. Because it's natively integrated, deployment of Defender for Cloud is easy, providing you with simple auto provisioning to secure your resources by default.
