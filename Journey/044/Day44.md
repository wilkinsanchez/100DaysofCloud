# Configuring a Microsoft Security Rule

## Introduction

During this lab I will work on configuring a Microsoft Security Rule. Rule templates were designed by Microsoft's team of security experts and analysts based on known threats, common attack vectors, and suspicious activity escalation chains. Rules created from these templates will automatically search across your environment for any activity that looks suspicious. Many of the templates can be customized to search for activities, or filter them out, according to your needs. The alerts generated by these rules will create incidents that you can assign and investigate in your environment.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

During this lab, I was able to complete the following:

1. Navigated through the Sentinel rule templates
2. Connected the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Data Source
3. Create incidents based on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts
4. Changed Severity level to High
