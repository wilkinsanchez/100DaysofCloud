# Identity and Access Management Security Baseline

## Introduction

During this lab I worked on configuring different IAM securite baselines for my Azure Tenant. Some of the configurations included the following:

* Restricting access to Azure AD admin portal.
* Enabling Azure AD MFA.
* Blocked remembering MFA for trusted devices.
* And more...

## Use Case

Identity management is key to granting access and to the security enhancement of corporate assets. To secure and control your cloud-based assets, you must manage identity and access for your Azure administrators, application developers, and application users.
