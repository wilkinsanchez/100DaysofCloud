# Defend against cyberthreats with Microsoft Defender XDR

## Introduction

✍️ I chose to complete this lab because Microsoft Defender XDR is a tool I use daily and is widely utilized by organizations worldwide. It's important to continuously sharpen these skills to stay effective.

## Use Case

1. Comprehensive Threat Detection Across Environments: With Defender XDR, you can unify threat detection across endpoints, emails, apps, and cloud services. It's easier for organizations to identify attacks that span across the environment.
2. Automated Incident Response and Remediation: This platform can automatically investigate alerts and take action to remediate threats. It leverages AI and automation, reducing the time it takes to contain breaches.
3. Advanded Threat Hunting with KQL: Analysts can use KQL (Kusto Query Language) to perform advanced hunting for unique or hidden threats. We can also create custom alerts that sends an email anytime a specific criteria is met.

## Cloud Research

During this lab, I configured a Defender XDR environment, managed devices with Defender for Endpoint, handled incidents, conducted endpoint investigations, and performed advanced threat hunting using KQL.
