# Deploy Microsoft Defender for Identity to On-premises AD Server

## Introduction

✍️ Today I learned about Microsoft Defender for Identity, also known as Azure ATP. It is a cloud-based security solution that leverages your on-premises Active Directory signals to identify, detect, and investigate advanced threats, compromised identities, and malicious insider actions directed at your organization.

## Use Case

With Microsoft Defender for Identity we can:

* Monitor users, entity behavior, and activities with learning-based analytics
* Protect user identities and credentials stored in Active Directory
* Identify and investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain
* Provide clear incident information on a simple timeline for fast triage

## Cloud Research

During this lab I was able to configure Microsoft Defender for Identity to my own on-premises AD server, provided credentials so the sensor can authenticate to the server and connect to the cloud, installed the sensor on the server, and modified the alerts so it can notify me of any malicious activity.
