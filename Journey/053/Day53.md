# Deploy and configure Azure Monitor

## Introduction

✍️ I chose to do this lab because tracking and analyzing the performance of Azure resources is essential to ensure they remain secure and operate as expected.

## Use Case

1. Proactive Resource Performance Management: With Azure Monitor we can track performance metrics such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk in real time.
2. Detect and Respond to Configuration Changes: We can track changes in cloud resources, integrate them with a Log Analytics workspace, and trigger alerts when specific criteria are met.

## Cloud Research

During this lab, I worked on creating and setting up a Log Analytics workspace, enabling change analysis, and configuring monitoring for applications, virtual machines, and virtual networks. Additionally, I set up alerts and automated responses to ensure efficient detection and management of potential issues.
