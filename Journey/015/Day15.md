# Deploy Web App that runs Docker Container

## Introduction

With this lab I learned how to deploy a Web App that runs on a Docker Container.

## Use Case

Today's learning was focused on deploying a Web app that runs a Docker container using Azure. We can easily pull container images from the Docker Hub or a private Azure Container Registry and the Web App will deploy a containerized app to production in seconds. Something cool I learned was that the platform takes care of OS patching, capacity provisioning, and load balancing.
