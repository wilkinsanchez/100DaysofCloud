# Azure AD Identity Protection

## Introduction

## What is Identity Protection?
Identity Protection is a tool that allows organizations to accomplish three key tasks:

* Automate the detection and remediation of identity-based risks.
* Investigate risks using data in the portal.
* Export risk detection data to third-party utilities for further analysis.
</br>
The signals generated by and fed to Identity Protection can be further fed into tools like Conditional Access to make access decisions, or fed back to a security information and event management (SIEM) tool for further investigation based on your organization's enforced policies.
</br>
AAD Identity Protection is solely focused on risks regarding user accounts, including sign-on attempts. These risks can be categorized as a ‘user risk’ such as credentials that are known to have been leaked or compromised, or as a ‘sign-in risk’’ related to the circumstances of the attempt to sign in, like the attempt coming from an anonymous IP address or a location that’s not usual for that account.

## Sign-in risk policy

Identity Protection analyzes signals from each sign-in, both real-time and offline, and calculates a risk score based on the probability that the sign-in wasn't performed by the user. Administrators can make a decision based on this risk score signal to enforce organizational requirements. Administrators can choose to block access, allow access, or allow access but require multi-factor authentication.

## User risk policy

Identity Protection can calculate what it believes is normal for a user's behavior and use that to base decisions for their risk. User risk is a calculation of the probability that an identity has been compromised. Administrators can make a decision based on this risk score signal to enforce organizational requirements. Administrators can choose to block access, allow access, or allow access but require a password change using Azure AD self-service password reset.

If a risk is detected, users can perform a self-service password reset to self-remediate and close the user risk event to prevent unnecessary noise for administrators.
## Use Case

Some use cases of Azure AD are:

* Protect Privileged Accounts with MFA
* Ban Commonly Attacked Passwords and Turn Off Traditional Complexity and Expiration Rules
* Automate Threat Response by implementing Sign-in and user risk policies.

## Cloud Research

For today's lab, I worked on configuring a user and sign-in risk policy for the users in my tenant. With this policy, we can make sure that users are protected if a risk is identified by Azure. Users will need to reset their password or complete an MFA challenge if the sign-in or user-risk meets the conditions.
