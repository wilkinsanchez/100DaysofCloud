# Configuring systems with Windows Autopilot

## Introduction

✍️ During this lab I worked on configuring systems using Windows Autopilot. It would pre-configure a device without user interaction.

## Use Case

Some of the use cases of Windows Autopilot includes:

* Streamlining New Device Deployment: Autopilot simplifies the process of setting up new Windows 10 or Windows 11 devices, making them business-ready without IT departments needing to manually handle each device.

* Zero Touch Deployment for Remote Workers: Especially useful for remote or off-site employees, Autopilot allows users to receive new devices that are already configured with necessary corporate policies and software.

* Resetting and Repurposing Devices: Autopilot can reset, repurpose, and recover devices, making it easier to manage the lifecycle of devices within an organization.

* Customized User Experience: Autopilot allows IT to customize the out-of-box experience for users, ensuring that necessary settings and applications are in place from the first time the user powers on the device.

* Integrating with Existing IT Infrastructure: Autopilot can be integrated with other Microsoft services like Azure AD and Intune for identity management and device management, creating a cohesive management experience.


## Cloud Research

During this lab I was able to configure the following:

* Multiple Autopilot profiles
* Tested an user driven and self deployed profiles
* Installed applications and settings during the deployment.

As part of this lab, I ran into issues where it would take more than 45 minutes to deploy. I reduced the time from 45 minutes to about 8 minutes by disabling the Enrollment Status Page (ESP). By doing that, all settings would apply right after the user login.
