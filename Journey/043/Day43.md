# Basic Configuration of a Microsoft Sentinel Environment

## Introduction

Microsoft Sentinel is a scalable, cloud-native, security information event management (SIEM) and security orchestration automated response (SOAR) solution. Microsoft Sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise, providing a single solution for alert detection, threat visibility, proactive hunting, and threat response.

Microsoft Sentinel is your birds-eye view across the enterprise alleviating the stress of increasingly sophisticated attacks, increasing volumes of alerts, and long resolution time frames.

* Collect data at cloud scale across all users, devices, applications, and infrastructure, both on-premises and in multiple clouds.

* Detect previously undetected threats, and minimize false positives using Microsoft's analytics and unparalleled threat intelligence.

* Investigate threats with artificial intelligence, and hunt for suspicious activities at scale, tapping into years of cyber security work at Microsoft.

* Respond to incidents rapidly with built-in orchestration and automation of common tasks.

1. Initialized a Microsoft Sentinel Workspace
2. Created a Watchlist of hosts I wanted to monitor
3. Created a Threat Indicator
