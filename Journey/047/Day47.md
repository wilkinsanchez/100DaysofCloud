# Configure Windows LAPS using Microsoft Intune

## Introduction

✍️ Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is a feature in Windows that helps manage and back up the password of a local administrator account on your Microsoft Entra ID joined devices or Windows Server Active Directory-joined devices. 

## Use Case

Some of the use cases of LAPS include:

* Mitigation agains Pass-the-Hash attacks
* Centralized password storage and access
* Automated Password Management
* Enhanced Security for local Administrator accounts

## Cloud Research

During this lab, I was able to provision a machine using Autopilot, created a policy to enable the built-in administrator account, configured the LAPS policy, rotated the password, and tested the settings.
