# Protecting Script secrets with Azure Key Vault

## Introduction

✍️ In today's digital landscape, securing sensitive information is imperative, especially when automating tasks with scripts that may contain secrets like passwords, API keys, and connection strings. Hardcoding these secrets poses a significant security risk and complicates script sharing and collaboration. Azure Key Vault provides a robust solution by securely storing these secrets and offering controlled access through policies and authentication mechanisms.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ During this lab, I worked on the following:

* Created a key vault
* Used PowerShell to create and read the secret
* Updated a test script with hardcoded secrets to use Key Vault instead.

## Social Proof
