# Deploy applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Introduction

Deploying applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) involves setting up and configuring a managed Kubernetes environment on Azure to run containerized applications. This process includes packaging applications into containers, creating a Kubernetes cluster in AKS, and then deploying these containers onto the cluster. AKS provides the necessary tools and infrastructure to orchestrate and manage these containers, including scaling, load balancing, and ensuring high availability. It simplifies the process of running Kubernetes by abstracting away much of the complexity involved in managing Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Use Case

Some use cases for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) are:

- Microservices Architecture
- DevOps and CI/CD
- Hybrid Cloud Environments
- AI and Machine Learning Workloads

## Cloud Research

For todays lab I worked on:

* Provisioning ACR & AKS: Grasped the essentials of setting up Azure Container Registry and Azure Kubernetes Service - a foundational step for any cloud-native development.

* Building Container Images: Stepped into the realm of containerization by building both Linux and Windows compatible container images, and learned about their storage in Azure Container Registry.

* Deployment to AKS: Implemented practical skills by deploying these container images onto Azure Kubernetes Service, enhancing my understanding of cloud-based container orchestration.

* Review and Deprovision: Rounded off the learning by reviewing deployments for efficiency and learned the importance of deprovisioning resources to optimize cloud resource management.
