# Introduction to KQL (Kusto Query Language)

## Introduction

A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. The request is stated in plain text, using a data-flow model designed to make the syntax easy to read, author, and automate. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQL's: databases, tables, and columns.

The query consists of a sequence of query statements, delimited by a semicolon (;), with at least one statement being a tabular expression statement which is a statement that produces data arranged in a table-like mesh of columns and rows. The query's tabular expression statements produce the results of the query.

Azure Monitor Logs is based on Azure Data Explorer, and log queries are written using the same Kusto query language (KQL). This is a rich language designed to be easy to read and author.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

During this lab, I learned about the following:

* Variables
* Search filters
* Creating fields
* Sorting results
* Creating visualizations with the Render operator
* Building multi-table statements

Based on my previous coding experience (Python), it won't be too dificult to take a good grasp of this language.
