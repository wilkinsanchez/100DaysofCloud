# Phishing and Password attack using MS 365

## Introduction

During this lab I worked on simulating a Phishing and Password attack for the users of my Microsoft 365 tenant. These simulated attacks can help you identify and find vulnerable users before a real attack impacts your environment.

Phishing is a generic term for email attacks that try to steal sensitive information in messages that appear to be from legitimate or trusted senders. Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack that uses focused and customized content that's specifically tailored to the targeted recipients (typically, after reconnaissance on the recipients by the attacker).

A password attack tries to guess passwords for user accounts in an organization, typically after the attacker has identified one or more valid user accounts.

## Use Case

The Microsoft attack simulator is a great tool for when you want to test your internal users ability to detect a spear phishing attack for example. Also, you can run a password attack in order to help you detect who is using weak credentials inside your IT environment.
