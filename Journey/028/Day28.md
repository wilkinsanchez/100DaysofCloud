# Creating and Restoring File Share Snapshots in Azure 

## Introduction

✍️ During today's lab I will learn how to create and restore file share snapshots in the Azure portal. For an organization and its users, it's very important that they have access to file versioning in case they need to go back and search for a file that was modified or deleted by an user. It is very simple to accomplish that in Azure.

## Use Case

An interesting use case would be:

* Multiple users access the same file/folder and we want to make sure that file versioning is available. The reason why, sometimes users make mistakes on the files or they get deleted accidentally.
* With Azure File Share Snapshots we can solve that problem.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

During this lab I was able to accomplish the following:

* Created VM to test the File Share.
* Created a new storage account.
* Created a file share in Azure.
* Connected the File Share to the VM using Powershell.
* Took a snapshot from the Azure portal and restored data.
