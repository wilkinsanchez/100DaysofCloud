# Deploying Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Introduction

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.

Defender for Endpoint uses the following combination of technology built into Windows 10 and Microsoft's robust cloud service:

* Endpoint behavioral sensors: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system and send this sensor data to your private, isolated, cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

* Cloud security analytics: Leveraging big-data, device-learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.

* Threat intelligence: Generated by Microsoft hunters, security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data.

## Prerequisite

* Basic knowledge of MS365
* Basic knowledge of Powershell

### Cloud Research

During this lab I was able to perform the following tasks:

1. Onboarded a Windows 10 device using a pre-configured script provided by Microsoft.
2. Configured Roles and Device groups
3. Simulated attacks
4. Reviewed incidents
