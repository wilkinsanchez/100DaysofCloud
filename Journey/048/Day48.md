# Configure and deploy ASR rules using Intune

## Introduction

Attack surface reduction rules target certain software behaviors, such as: Launching executable files and scripts that attempt to download or run files. Running obfuscated or otherwise suspicious scripts. Performing behaviors that apps don't usually initiate during normal day-to-day work.

## Use Case

With ASR rules we can do the following:

* Block Executable content from Email and Web.
* Block Credential Theft.
* Protect against Ransomware
* Limit JS or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content.
* Controll access to Powershell.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

During this lab, I configured and deployed all ASR rules in Audit mode to a group of devices. It's recommended to run these rules in Audit mode before Block mode. The reason why, it would allow you to set the necessary exclusions before blocking an approved business app.
