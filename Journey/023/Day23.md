# Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policies

## Introduction

Organizations must protect sensitive information and prevent its inadvertent disclosure. Sensitive information can include financial data or personally identifiable information (PII) such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, or health records. With a data loss prevention (DLP) policy in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive information across Office 365.

## Use Case

With a DLP policy, you can:

* Identify sensitive information across many locations, such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams.

    For example, you can identify any document containing a credit card number that's stored in any OneDrive for Business site, or you can monitor just the OneDrive sites of specific people.

* Prevent the accidental sharing of sensitive information.

    For example, you can identify any document or email containing a health record that's shared with people outside your organization, and then automatically block access to that document or block the email from being sent.

* Monitor and protect sensitive information in the desktop versions of Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

    Just like in Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business, these Office desktop programs include the same capabilities to identify sensitive information and apply DLP policies. DLP provides continuous monitoring when people share content in these Office programs.

* Help users learn how to stay compliant without interrupting their workflow.

    You can educate your users about DLP policies and help them remain compliant without blocking their work. For example, if a user tries to share a document containing sensitive information, a DLP policy can both send them an email notification and show them a policy tip in the context of the document library that allows them to override the policy if they have a business justification. The same policy tips also appear in Outlook on the web, Outlook, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.

* View DLP alerts and reports showing content that matches your organizationâ€™s DLP policies.

    To view alerts and metadata related to your DLP policies you can use the DLP Alerts Management Dashboard. You can also view policy match reports to assess how your organization is complying with a DLP policy. If a DLP policy allows users to override a policy tip and report a false positive, you can also view what users have reported
