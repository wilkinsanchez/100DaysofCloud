# Create Azure AD Dynamic group

## Introduction

Dynamic membership enables the membership of a team to be defined by one or more rules that check for certain user attributes in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Users are automatically added or removed to the correct group as user attributes change or users join and leave the tenant.

## Use Case

With dynamic membership you can set up groups for certain cohorts of users in your organization. Possible scenarios include:

* A hospital can create distinct teams for nurses, doctors, and surgeons to broadcast communications. This is especially important if the hospital relies on temp employees.

* A university can create a team for all faculty within a particular college, including an adjunct faculty that changes frequently.

* An airline wants to create a team for each flight (like a Tuesday afternoon non-stop from Chicago to Atlanta) and have a frequently changing flight crew automatically assigned or removed as needed.

## Cloud Research

During this lab I created a dynamic group that adds all the Sales members in the City of Providence. We can manage a big number of users with Dynamic rules. For example, let's assume that a big corporation hires 200 Engineers, how would you re-arrange each one of them into their correspondings groups? We can do it manually, but it's time consuming and not efficient. However, using Dynamic rules can make our jobs easier.
